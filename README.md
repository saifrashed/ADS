<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Algorithms and Data structures builds on the knowledge and skills i have developed 
during the first-year programming courses (Programming, OOP1 and OOP2). Now, i will 
learn and practice implementation of more complex algorithms and data structures. The use 
cases will more authentic and related to real business problems and i will explore how 
commonly used data structures work under the hood.

Subjects:
* Abstract Data Types, wrapper classes, interfaces, exceptions 
* List, ArrayList, LinkedList, local class, linear search, representation invariants 
* Generics, Iterable, Iterator
* Functional Interfaces, lambda expressions Comparator, List.sort
* Recursion, binary search, loop invariants
* Big-O efficiency, simple sorts 
* MergeSort, QuickSort,
* Stack, Queue, Heap 
* Hashing, HashSets, HashMaps
* (Binary) Search Trees, TreeSet, TreeMap 
* Streams, Reducers, Collectors, Method chaining
* Graphs, Spanning Tree, Builder pattern
* Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search. 
* Minimum Spanning Tree, Dijkstra shortest path

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
