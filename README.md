## About The Project

Algorithms and Data Structures builds on the knowledge and skills i have developed 
during the first-year programming courses (Programming, OOP1 and OOP2). Now, i will 
learn and practice implementation of more complex algorithms and data structures. The use 
cases will more authentic and related to real business problems and i will explore how 
commonly used data structures work under the hood.

Subjects:
* Abstract Data Types, wrapper classes, interfaces, exceptions 
* List, ArrayList, LinkedList, local class, linear search, representation invariants 
* Generics, Iterable, Iterator
* Functional Interfaces, lambda expressions Comparator, List.sort
* Recursion, binary search, loop invariants
* Big-O efficiency, simple sorts 
* MergeSort, QuickSort,
* Stack, Queue, Heap 
* Hashing, HashSets, HashMaps
* (Binary) Search Trees, TreeSet, TreeMap 
* Streams, Reducers, Collectors, Method chaining
* Graphs, Spanning Tree, Builder pattern
* Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search. 
* Minimum Spanning Tree, Dijkstra shortest path
